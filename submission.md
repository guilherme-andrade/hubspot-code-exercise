# Submission Notes

These notes will be read by HubSpot developers. Drop us a line!

## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

- Lightly redesigned the CSS to use Hubspot's branding and reorganized the `styled-components`ðŸ’… structure to reuse more `theme` variables.

- Improved **animations**.

- Write a simple feature `test` for the filtering exercise.

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

- I didn't reuse the HTML structure of EJS files for the first exercise, simply because I misread the guidelines initially ðŸ™ƒ

 - I used `Webpack` instead of `Gulp` because I'm more familiar with it and felt more comfortable setting up plugins like `ESlint` and using a `dev-server`.

- I didn't write `CSS` in separate files because I like the `styled-components` paradigm and the flexibility it provides, especially for it's reusability for Web and native applications.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

The Component Structure is definitely overdone for the scope of this exercise, but I believe that scalability is a lot about keeping patterns consistent to make it easier for other developers to understand your code.
